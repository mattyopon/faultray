# FaultZero

> Zero-risk infrastructure chaos simulation. Prove your availability ceiling mathematically.

## What is FaultZero?

FaultZero simulates infrastructure failures without touching production. It builds a mathematical model of your infrastructure and runs thousands of failure scenarios to identify single points of failure, cascade risks, and availability ceilings — all without any real-world impact.

Unlike traditional chaos engineering tools that inject real faults into live systems, FaultZero operates entirely on a virtual model. This means you can evaluate resilience during design reviews, CI/CD pipelines, and pre-deployment checks.

## Key Features

- **Zero-risk simulation** — No production impact, ever
- **5-layer infrastructure model** — Compute, storage, network, DNS, CDN
- **150+ failure scenarios** — SPOF detection, cascade analysis, regional outages
- **Resilience scoring** — Quantified 0-100 score with actionable recommendations
- **Cloud-native scanning** — Auto-import from AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes
- **Terraform integration** — Scan IaC before deployment
- **CI/CD integration** — Gate deployments on resilience thresholds
- **Insurance-grade scoring** — Compliance and risk assessment reports

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install faultzero
faultzero quickstart
```

This generates a sample infrastructure model and runs a basic simulation, producing a resilience report in seconds.
